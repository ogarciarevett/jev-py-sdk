"""The masked Jev decision log, one JSONL file per UTC day.

Python port of jev-sdk `src/decision-log.ts`, writing the same line format so the upstream
`jev-report` can read our logs. Two kinds of line share a file. A `decision` line is one call: the
masked state digest, the masked questions, the bar each one had to clear and the verdict it gave. An
`outcome` line is what happened afterwards, keyed on the same digest.

The raw state never reaches this file. Only the digest of the masked text does.
